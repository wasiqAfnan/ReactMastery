        This application is built to demonstrate the concepts of React Router in
        a simple and practical way. Youâ€™ll see examples of normal routing,
        NavLink, useNavigate, and nested routes all in one place.

      <p className="text-gray-400 max-w-2xl mx-auto">
        Our goal is to help learners understand how routing works in React step
        by step.
